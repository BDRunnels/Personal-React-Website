                <p id="paragraphHobbies"> Apart from learning to code and develop, I have a plethora of hobbies! Now, the quote above may lead you to believe that I am obsessed with body building. I am not. This quote is merely a guide on my journey to self care. Maintaining this "well built physique" is a metaphor to lead a healthy lifestyle: physically and mentally.  </p>

                <p> I first got into bowling after viewing one of the quintessential comedy films, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski"> The Big Lebowski.</a> After pursuing it as a youth, it has become a weekly activity as I've progressed into adulthood. Throughout the years, I've been fortunate enough to hit a few substantial milestones in <a href="https://bowl.com">USBC</a> sanctioned competition. Below are three videos that teammates recorded, throughout the years: </p>

                <p> Every recreational bowler's dream is to bowl both a 300 (perfect game) and an 800 series. In the competitive world, the vast majority of bowling leagues are three games. In order to bowl an 800 series, a bowler needs to average ~267 for those 3 games: an enviable task! I have yet to accomplish that in my 25 years as a bowler.</p>
            
            <h3 id="bass"> Bass Guitar <img className="aboutPic" src="https://blog.zzounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/victor-wooten-bass-fodera.jpg" alt="Victor Wooten's Bass Guitar"></img> </h3>
                <p> Beginning about the same era as bowling, I received a gift of a bass guitar. At first, I was quite unhappy as my sister received a traditional six-string guitar. Being ~12 years old, I thought to myself: now who pays attention to the bass guitar? It's always in the background! How silly I was. Virtuosos like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wooten">Victor Wooten</a> inspired me to become, not only a better musician, but a better person. </p> <br/>
                <br/>
                <p> I've been apart of numerous musicial groups throughout my life, from surf rock and funk, to heavy metal. Now, I focus mainly on writing my own material and playing classical songs transcribed for bass guitar. Below is a clip of me performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hamm">Stu Hamm's</a> rendition of the National Anthem at a friend's studio. I was fortunate enough to perform this before a sporting event in front of the incumbent Governor of Kansas several years ago: with no mistakes! At least to my knowledge...

                <p> Being fortunate enough to reside in the beautiful state of Colorado in the foothills of <a href="https://www.colorado.com/cities-and-towns/evergreen">Evergreen</a> has truly provided perspective for me. Looking outside my windows at the bountiful trees, creeks, and mountains provides a certain calming and centering effect that the big city lacks. In fact, there is mounting evidence that 'clocking out' from our devices and screen time, leads to a plethora of benefits (American Psychological Association. (2020, April 1). <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/04/nurtured-nature">Nurtured by nature</a>. Monitor on Psychology, 51(3).)</p> <br/>

                <p>Whether it is a strenuous hike, a serene visit to <a href="https://www.evergreenrecreation.com/219/Lake-Activities">Evergreen Lake</a>, or merely stepping outside to breathe deep and decompress, taking care of yourself is just a step outside. A few of my favorite places to visit locally:</p>
